Git is not a tool for managing configuration files.  That's why this is an ansible repo.

## my rules
* I am not going to make this extensible, this is not a drag and drop solution.  This is my way of creating a transient solution for my Linux workstation configuration and its management.
* My preferred habit is to have a desktop environment that is wholly disposable.  My workstation is simply the compute behind the tools stored elsewhere.
* If I like having nice things, I should put them here.  (And then delete them from my localhost)
